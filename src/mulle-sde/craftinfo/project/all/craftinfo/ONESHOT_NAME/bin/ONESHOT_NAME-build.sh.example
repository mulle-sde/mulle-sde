# This is an example build script. Build scripts can be useful, if the
# project is based on make or some other non-mulle-make-supported build system.
#
# Rename it to build.sh and move it to the appropriate info directory folder,
# maybe <dependency>.linux, if its just applicable to linux.
#
# Enable it with:
#    mulle-sde dependency craftinfo --platform linux set <dependency> BUILD_SCRIPT build.sh
#
# Enable scripts with:
#    mulle-sde environment set MULLE_SDE_ALLOW_BUILD_SCRIPT 'YES'
#
# Hint: If this gets too complicated and you are tempted to massage the
#       Makefile, maybe it's easier to use the project embedded and compile
#       the sources yourself with cmake ?
