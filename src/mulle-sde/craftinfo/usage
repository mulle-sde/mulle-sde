Used by the command `extension pimp` to set up a subproject to
hold the build settings for a dependency. This somewhat complicated setup
allows other projects to inherit your settings.

See: `mulle-sde dependency defintion help` for more help on this topic.

Define the environment variable ONESHOT_NAME so that properly named extension
file names and file contents can be created.

Example:

   mulle-sde extension pimp --oneshot-name "foo" mulle-sde/craftinfo
